## Overview

VoxCPM is a novel tokenizer-free Text-to-Speech (TTS) system that redefines realism in speech synthesis. By modeling speech in a continuous space, it overcomes the limitations of discrete tokenization and enables two flagship capabilities: context-aware speech generation and true-to-life zero-shot voice cloning.

Unlike mainstream approaches that convert speech to discrete tokens, VoxCPM uses an end-to-end diffusion autoregressive architecture that directly generates continuous speech representations from text. Built on [MiniCPM-4](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4-0.5B) backbone, it achieves implicit semantic-acoustic decoupling through hierachical language modeling and FSQ constraints, greatly enhancing both expressiveness and generation stability.

###  üöÄ Key Features
- **Context-Aware, Expressive Speech Generation** - VoxCPM comprehends text to infer and generate appropriate prosody, delivering speech with remarkable expressiveness and natural flow. It spontaneously adapts speaking style based on content, producing highly fitting vocal expression trained on a massive 1.8 million-hour bilingual corpus.
- **True-to-Life Voice Cloning** - With only a short reference audio clip, VoxCPM performs accurate zero-shot voice cloning, capturing not only the speaker‚Äôs timbre but also fine-grained characteristics such as accent, emotional tone, rhythm, and pacing to create a faithful and natural replica.
- **High-Efficiency Synthesis** - VoxCPM supports streaming synthesis with a Real-Time Factor (RTF) as low as 0.17 on a consumer-grade NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, making it possible for real-time applications.

    retry_badcase_max_times=3,  # maximum retrying times
    retry_badcase_ratio_threshold=6.0, # maximum length restriction for bad case detection (simple but effective), it could be adjusted for slow pace speech
)

sf.write("output.wav", wav, 16000)
print("saved: output.wav")
```

### 3. CLI Usage

After installation, the entry point is `voxcpm` (or use `python -m voxcpm.cli`).

```bash
# 1) Direct synthesis (single text)
voxcpm --text "VoxCPM is an innovative end-to-end TTS model from ModelBest, designed to generate highly expressive speech." --output out.wav

## üë©‚Äçüç≥ A Voice Chef's Guide
Welcome to the VoxCPM kitchen! Follow this recipe to cook up perfect generated speech. Let‚Äôs begin.

---
### ü•ö Step 1: Prepare Your Base Ingredients (Content)

First, choose how you‚Äôd like to input your text:.
1. Regular Text (Classic Mode)
- ‚úÖ Keep "Text Normalization" ON. Type naturally (e.g., "Hello, world! 123"). The system will automatically process numbers, abbreviations, and punctuation using WeTextProcessing library.
2. Phoneme Input (Native Mode)
- ‚ùå Turn "Text Normalization" OFF. Enter phoneme text like {HH AH0 L OW1} (EN) or {ni3}{hao3} (ZH) for precise pronunciation  control. In this mode, VoxCPM also supports native understanding of other complex non-normalized text‚Äîtry it out!

---
### üç≥ Step 2: Choose Your Flavor Profile (Voice Style) 

This is the secret sauce that gives your audio its unique sound.
1. Cooking with a Prompt Speech (Following a Famous Recipe)
  - A prompt speech provides the desired acoustic characteristics for VoxCPM. The speaker's timbre, speaking style, and even the background sounds and ambiance will be replicated.
  - For a Clean, Studio-Quality Voice:
    - ‚úÖ Enable "Prompt Speech Enhancement". This acts like a noise filter, removing background hiss and rumble to give you a pure, clean voice clone.
2. Cooking au Naturel (Letting the Model Improvise)
  - If no reference is provided, VoxCPM becomes a creative chef! It will infer a fitting speaking style based on the text itself, thanks to the text-smartness of its foundation model, MiniCPM-4.
  - Pro Tip: Challenge VoxCPM with any text‚Äîpoetry, song lyrics, dramatic monologues‚Äîit may deliver some interesting results!

---
### üßÇ Step 3: The Final Seasoning (Fine-Tuning Your Results)
You're ready to serve! But for master chefs who want to tweak the flavor, here are two key spices.
- CFG Value (How Closely to Follow the Recipe)
  - Default: A great starting point.
  - Voice sounds strained or weird? Lower this value. It tells the model to be more relaxed and improvisational, great for expressive prompts.
  - Need maximum clarity and adherence to the text? Raise it slightly to keep the model on a tighter leash.
- Inference Timesteps (Simmering Time: Quality vs. Speed)
  - Need a quick snack? Use a lower number. Perfect for fast drafts and experiments.
  - Cooking a gourmet meal? Use a higher number. This lets the model "simmer" longer, refining the audio for superior detail and naturalness.

---
Happy creating! üéâ Start with the default settings and tweak from there to suit your project. The kitchen is yours!
